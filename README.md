# University Management Distributed System

## Overview

This project is a distributed system, written in Java, designed to manage all aspects of a university. The system offers robust features including:

- **QR Code Generation:** Generate QR codes for each student and employee badge to facilitate secure identification and access.
- **Flexible File Handling:** Create, edit, and distribute files in PDF or Excel formats. These files can be shared flexibly between users, students, and employees.
- **Secure Authentication:** Users interact with the application by authenticating via their badge (QR code) or a secure password.
- **Java Implementation:** This repository contains the complete Java implementation of the system.
- **Other Implementation:** A version of the same system has also been developed in C# (available in a separate repository).

## Features

- Generate and assign QR codes for student and employee identity badges.
- Export student or employee data and other reports as PDF or Excel files.
- Edit and manage document content before distribution.
- Distribute documents efficiently to relevant users or groups.
- User authentication is required for all operations (badge or password).
